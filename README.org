#+title: SSPP networks

Julia modules for simulating SSPP networks

* WaveSystem model

Low-dimensional model of SSPP networks.

=WS.lj= - The base module implementing the single-channel network. The
channel implements an inhomogeneous wave-system with local resonances with
general boundary conditions. The system response is evaluated at fixed
frequency using the invariant imbedding technique adapted to the transfer
matrix approach with sources.
